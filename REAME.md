# Sephora SMS Stock Notifier 

This is a personal project used for sephora.com.

This is a CLI script that will check the stock of an item every 1 minute or whichever time variable you would like to set.

You will need a twilio account with a working number, account id, and api key in order to send text message notifications to the whatever number you supply.
