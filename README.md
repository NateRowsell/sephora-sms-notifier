# Sephora SMS Stock Notifier 

This is a personal project used for sephora.com.

This is a CLI script that will check the stock of an item every 1 minute or whichever time variable you would like to set. Once your selected item comes in stock you will be sent an sms notification with the link to the selected product.

You will need a twilio account with a working number, account id, and api key in order to send text message notifications to the whatever number you supply.
